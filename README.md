# Roller Coaster

### TODO

- Make roller coaster circular
- Animate words so they rotate around their container in a small radius when roller coaster is idle
- Add wind animation so when words pass/exit show word area, the wind moves
- Try to make the bottom half of the roller coaster opaque, so you only focus or can really see the top half. Might just make the bottom half so from the 2nd cell (cell after shown word area) to the n / 2 rounded down cell
- See if we can make the roller coaster close up like kinda zoomed in? Maybe play around with translateZ value or scene value (seems scene can only show you so close up)
